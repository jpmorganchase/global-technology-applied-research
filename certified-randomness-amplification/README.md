# Code for *Certified randomness amplification by dynamically probing remote random quantum states*

This repository contains the code to reproduce figures in the paper *Certified randomness amplification by dynamically probing remote random quantum states*.

For the main text:
- Fig 3d is part of `restricted_model_analysis.ipynb`
- Fig 3e,f are part of `oracle_model_analysis.ipynb`
- XEB analysis (once probabilities are calculated) is in `xeb.ipynb`

For the supplement:
- An example run of the post-cost tensor network contraction optimization algorithm can be found in `post_cost_optimization_example.ipynb`
- All other notebooks produce supplementary figures.

For optimization of tensor network contraction order used for validation, actual validation on the Aurora supercomputer, and weak randomness generation and extraction, see respective folder readme files.
